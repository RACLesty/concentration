# Ricardo A. Colon Lopez - Pokemon Memory Game

## Game Description - Pokemon Memory
This is a game of Concentration/Memory made with Pok√©mon cards. The goal of the game is to match six pairs of cards before the timer hits 0, and the player only has 30 seconds to do so. The timer will start and cards will be shuffled once you enter the game and when the game is restarted. Once the player has successfully matched all cards, a message will let the player know that he or she has won. If the timer reaches 0 seconds, a message will also be displayed stating that the player has lost.

## Technologies Used
I used HTML to create the game's structure, utilizing elements like h1 for the title, div for the timer and card containers, p for outcome messages, and a button for game restart.

I used CSS to applied style to various elements including cards, card wrappers, fonts, backgrounds, timer, messages, buttons, and colors, enhancing the game's appearance and layout.

JavaScript was used to implement game functionality, including shuffling cards, handling card selection, and checking for matches using forEach loops. Event listeners respond to user interactions, updating the game state and display messages
dynamically, while functions organize the code for clarity and maintainability.

## Plans for the future

I'd like to introduce several enhancements to the game. Firstly, I aim to incorporate a local database to record and showcase the fastest gameplays on a scoreboard. Additionally, I plan to introduce multiple levels and potentially integrate additional mini-games. Lastly, I intend to enhance the game's aesthetics by upgrading its style.
